Every programmer should have a portfolio. When I'm hiring, I want to see what you've built. I want to see your code. I want to see how you write.

Those who had a portfolio on their resume where I could learn more about them, their projects, and the code they've written were more likely to get a response from me when interviewing.

## Why write?

After finishing my post, [How Stripe Designs Beautiful Websites](/blog/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites), I posted a link to the article on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

I was immediately receiving 10x the traffic to my site as before. The article ended up hitting #1 on Hacker News and [/r/web_design](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/).

This ultimately led to the article being reposted across a bunch of different websites. It continued to grow organically throughout the day, bringing in ~70,000 views in 24 hours.

This traffic created two notable events:

- My average site traffic doubled
- My portfolio moved from the 3rd page of Google to the 1st

## What to include

- **Show code:** Ideally links to GitHub repositories, including live demo URLs where I can see the things you've built. I'll go explore the codebase and see what tech choices you used. Bonus points if you wrote about _why_ you picked that tech stack.
- **Write stuff:** An average engineer who can write well and explain concepts clearly is better than an excellent engineer who can't communicate with their coworkers. Show me you are a clear writer, which is especially important if the role is remote.
- **Own your SEO:** Google yourself and make sure you own the first page (not always easy, but worth influencing). Capture a domain name and build credibility. You might end up keeping that "digital home" throughout your career.
- **Make it unique:** Express yourself. Use a creative design. Spent the extra hour on the [animation polish](https://delba.dev/blog/a-like-button-that-likes-you-back). Add something unique you haven't seen others do before.
- **Show, don't tell:** You _said_ you have experience with React â€“ show me.
