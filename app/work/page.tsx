          Since I joined Vercel in 2020, Next.js active developers have grown
          1000%, now at ~900k. Next.js is now a top 10 software project on
          GitHub with <Stars />. It's used by Walmart, ChatGPT, Starbucks, Okta,

          Hy-Vee, an almost 100-year-old grocery chain in the United States,
          wanted to build a new version of their digital storefront. I joined a
          team of <Link href="/blog/product-engineers">product engineers</Link>{' '}
          working across web and mobile to rebuild their legacy .NET application
          (~500k MAU) with React and React Native.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the frontend, I led our move from a custom webpack and React
          configuration to Next.js and the latest React patterns. In the
          process, I shared my learnings online, helping educate members of the
          React and Next.js community by creating courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my two years, I was able to work on some hard problems:
          decoupling a decade old monolith into microservices, working with a
          federated GraphQL API, learning and occasionally managing a Kubernetes
          cluster, building and implementing a design system, incrementally
          migrating individual components and routes to a new framework and
          infrastructure, and more.

          Workiva ($WK) is a cloud platform for data reporting and compliance.
          During my time at Workiva, I gained my first production experience
          using React. I worked on tooling to help predict and alert and
          regressions in our SaaS platform, building a product similar to
          open-source tools like Sentry.
