## Introduction

When you find yourself struggling to grasp React development skills while studying the documentation, what better way to deeply understand React's core concepts than building a React yourself? 

In this article, I'll guide you step by step on how to build React from scratch, and you'll personally implement those core concepts of React from 2013 (`React 0.3`) to 2019 (`React 16.8`), gaining a profound understanding of their design principles and the trade-offs made during the evolution of technology.

This series will be divided into three articles, The features we'll implement include:

### I: Basic Feature Implementation

**Render:** Introduced in `React 0.13 (2015)`, the render function is used to render the virtual DOM to the real DOM.

**JSX:** Also introduced in `React 0.13 (2015)`, JSX syntax provides a convenient way to write component structures and converts it into calls to the createElement function.

**Props:** In `React 0.3 (2013)`, the functionality of passing props was introduced, allowing components to receive data from parent components.

### II: Enhanced Core Features

**VDOM:** In `React 0.3 (2013)`, the concept of virtual DOM was introduced, used to compare and update the real DOM to improve performance.

**Event Binding:** Also introduced in `React 0.3 (2013)`, event binding functionality allows components to respond to user interactions.

**Task Scheduler & Fiber:** Introduced in `React 16 (2017)`, the Fiber architecture is a redesigned scheduler used to implement priority scheduling of component updates, preventing render blocking.

### III: Advanced Features and State Management

**Diff Algorithm:** In `React 0.3 (2013)`, the diff algorithm based on virtual DOM was introduced, used to compare differences in virtual DOM to minimize DOM operations and improve performance.

**Function Component:** In `React 16.8 (2019)`, Hooks were introduced, including useState and useEffect, as well as the implementation of function components.

**useState:** Also introduced in `React 16.8 (2019)`, the useState hook allows function components to have their own state.

**useEffect:** Also introduced in `React 16.8 (2019)`, the useEffect hook is used to handle component side effects such as data fetching and subscriptions.

## Step Zero:Render

让我们一步步来创建一个简单的 React 渲染器，并逐步优化它。我们将从一个简单的 HTML 文件开始，然后逐步引入 React 的核心概念。

### Render-1. 创建 HTML 文件

首先，我们创建一个基本的 HTML 文件，其中包含一个根元素 div，并给它一个 id 为 "root"，以便我们将 React 元素渲染到这个元素中。
